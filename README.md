## Getting started

This section explains how to install Desk SDK for Android before testing the sample app. If you're familiar with using external libraries or SDKs in your projects, installing the Desk SDK will be an easy and straightforward process. 

### Install Desk SDK for Android

Installing the Chat SDK is simple if you're familiar with using external libraries or SDKs. First, add the following code to your **root** `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://repo.sendbird.com/public/maven" }
    }

```

> **Note**: Make sure the above code block isn't added to your module `bundle.gradle` file.

Then, add the dependency to the project's top-level `build.gradle` file.
